This application is a Sudoku solver based on genetic algorithms. It was developed as part of an academic course on Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of evolutionary computation techniques to constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. It showcases the fundamentals of AI such as population-based search, selection, crossover, and mutation in an interactive and educational way.
